## Ready to contribute?

### System Requirements

Depending on the platform and chosen configuration, some libraries or extra services are required.

The following commands will install necessary tools for cryptography and Python packaging like Virtualenv.

#### Linux
On Debian / Ubuntu based systems:

```bash
apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev python-dev python-virtualenv
```

#### OS X
Assuming [brew](http://brew.sh/) is installed:

```bash
brew install libffi openssl pkg-config python

pip install virtualenv
```

### Getting Started

 -  Fork the repo on GitHub and clone locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kinto/kinto-http.py.git
git remote add {your_name} git@github.com:{your_name}/kinto-http.py.git
```

## Testing

 -  `make tests-once` to run the tests with the current venv.
 -  `make tests` to run all the tests (with python3, flake8, and functional tests)

You may need to use `make run-kinto` before running the functional tests.
If you want to run the functional tests only, you can use `make functional`.

## Submitting Changes

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b issue_number-bug-title
git commit # Your changes
git push -u {your_name} issue_number-bug-title
```

Then you can create a Pull-Request.
Please create your pull-request as soon as you have at least one commit even if it has only failing tests. This will allow us to help and give guidance.

You will be able to update your pull-request by pushing commits to your branch.
